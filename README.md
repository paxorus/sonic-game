# Sonic
2D single-player platform game.

## Issues
* Apply force, not velocity, to walk: Nice-to-have that will make turning a little smoother with skidding.
* Apply force, not velocity, to jump: Nice-to-have for smoother gravity.
* Jumps should go forward if holding down L/R.
* Realistic collisions: Resize body based on locus.
* Unlimited power: Pressing down after releasing space gives another jolt of energy.

## Feature Ideas
* Moving platforms
* Rings
* Enemies
